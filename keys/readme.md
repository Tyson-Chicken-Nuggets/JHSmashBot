# keys
In this folder, create three `.txt` files as follows:
..- `token.txt`
..- `url.txt`
..- `key.txt`

The `url.txt` and `key.txt` files contain the canvas api url and api keys respectively, as specified by [the canvasapi python wrapper](https://github.com/ucfopen/canvasapi#quickstart "canvasapi") for the canvas api.
The `token.txt` file contains the token for the discord bot, which is necessary for the bot to run. [Click here to find out more about discord bot tokens](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token "Creating a Discord Bot and Getting a Token").
